## Introduction

Increment Instagram influence

This project is probably one of the most ambitious projects I have worked so far. There are different goals, firstly we need to understand what makes a person engage with an Instagram account, this will be specific for the theme I have chosen.
Secondly, this can be used to help someone already stablished with an Instagram account to further improve their engage with their audience and increment their followers 
However, the main goal is to use the recommendations given at the end of the study and get an Instagram account as far as possible. 
There is going to be involved Natural Language Processing, Time Series analysis (as a bench mark) , Machine learning for Classification and finally some AWS using EC2 and Lambda to run the scripts at certain times. 

## Business Problem

- Learn the practices that make an Instagram account popular. 
- This can benefit anyone that wants to build a presence in this social network platform.
- The goal of this study is to use the study to create an Instagram page and follow the recommendations  to grow an audience

## Findings 
### Exploratory Analysis

Within my data there were four different Instagram accounts, these accounts however, had the same theme. A theme: is a type of content that the Instagram account owner posts about. For example: cars, motorbikes, country. 
The theme I have chosen was a city : London. 
Getting the average, we can appreciate that the Instagram users that follow this kind of Instagram pages are more active Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 




Looking at each Instagram account individually we can differentiate how their followers react to their posts.

Lastly, Visit London: Saturday, Thursday and Wednesdays are where the average likes are higher.

I will now look at the what times are best to post:

We can further Explore within the day, the time of the day with a higher average of likes, 
Due to the time constrain I will not be able to go through all the Instagram pages. However, Exploring London will serve as an example. 
We can see that posting on Monday at either 05am, 12pm or 21 gets the account more likes on average. 
Friday in the other hand, 13:00 and 14:.00 gets the most likes

I conducted some text classification in the caption of the posts.  This allowed me to generate the best captions for the pictures. 
We can see the top 30 words used in the captions of the pictures.  For my surprise Hackney is number 30.
