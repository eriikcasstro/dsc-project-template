# Module 4 Final Project


## Introduction

This is my module 4 project which consists of helping a company to make some business decisions based on a time series model, that predicts sales data for two categories


## Business Problem
The data set is a super store dataset. 
XYZ Superstore has had some trouble in the past two years. It is believed that the issue lies within the dataset provided. XYZ Superstore requires a forecast in sales for furniture and office supplies for the following 12 to 24 months. Reasoning the months that sales are expected to flare up. They also require a list of 3 business recommendations based on the findings. 

## Findings 
For the office supplies department, during the months of November and December the sales increase dramatically. Therefore, it is recommended:
- To hire more personnel as this will be needed. 
- It is also recommended to have enough stock to maintain a high quality service for every customer that desires to buy Office   Supplies. 
- Sales in Office Supplies increase steadily throughout the years, therefore, maintaining a minmium of employess in this section is recommended

Moving to furniture, August and December are the months where sales spike up dramatically. 
This indicates that: 
- A minimum personnel is to be maintained throughout these months, perhaps even increasing workforce.
- Increasing stock this month is also recommended as sales will increase .
- January to May are quiet months therefore personnel can be redirected to different departments.

The volume of sales per month for both Office Supplies and Furniture, increase steadily over time. However, Office Supplies does trend higher than Furniture.
